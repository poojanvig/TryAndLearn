    <h1>C Intoduction</h1>
    <p>C language was invented in 1972 and is one of the oldest programming language</p>
    <p><strong>Features:-</strong><br>
      1. C is a structured language i.e. it programs can be divided in multiple parts which makes it easy to understand
      and write.<br>
      2. Easy & Effective<br>
      Efficient & fast programs against other languages<br>
      3. Can be used to program computer to work efficiently.<br>
    </p>
    <li><strong>Where to use C language:-</strong></li><br>
    <p>
      1. Creating Desktop applications.<br>
      2. Developing Games.<br>
      3. Designing Operating System.<br>
      4. Designing Compilers.<br>
    </p>
    <li><strong>Working of C</strong><br></li>
    <strong>Writing source code</strong><br>
    Writing source code for desired project using text editing tool<br>
    <strong>Compiling source code</strong><br>
    Converting source code to machine instructions so as computer can understand<br>
    <strong>Error detection</strong><br>
    Checking code for all possible errors<br>
    <strong>Linking</strong><br>
    Linking code with other files of code as sometimes it because putting all codes in one file becomes difficult<br>
    <strong>Checking errors</strong><br>
    Again errors are rectified <br>
    <strong>Execution</strong><br>
    Code is executed to get desired output
    <h2><strong>Keywords & Identifiers</strong></h2>
    <span>
      <h3>keywords</h3>
      Keywords are predefined, reserved words used in programming that have special meanings to the compiler. Keywords
      are
      part of the syntax and they cannot be used as an identifier.<br>
      Example :
      <code><pre><code class="language-clike">
            #include<stdio.h>

                int main()
                {
                    float a, b;
                    printf("Showing how keywords are used.");
                    return 0;
                }</code>
      </pre>

      In the above program, float and return are keywords. The float is used to declare variables, and return is used to
      return an integer type value in this program.<br>
      A list of 32 reserved keywords in c language is given below:

      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <td>auto</td>
          <td>double</td>
          <td>int</td>
          <td>struct</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>break</td>
          <td>else</td>
          <td>long</td>
          <td>switch</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>case</td>
          <td>enum</td>
          <td>register</td>
          <td>typedef</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>char</td>
          <td>extern</td>
          <td>return</td>
          <td>union</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>const</td>
          <td>float</td>
          <td>short</td>
          <td>unsigned</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>continue</td>
          <td>for</td>
          <td>signed</td>
          <td>void</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>default</td>
          <td>goto</td>
          <td>sizeof</td>
          <td>volatile</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>do</td>
          <td>if</td>
          <td>static</td>
          <td>while</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Identifiers</h3>
      Identifier refers to name given to entities such as variables, functions, structures etc. Identifiers must be
      unique. They are created to give a unique name to an entity to identify it during the execution of the
      program.<br>
      Example:
      <pre> <code class="language-clike">
            int amount;

            double totalbalance;</code>
            </pre>
      In the above example, amount and totalbalance are identifiers and int, and double are keywords.
      <h3>Rules for Naming Identifiers</h3>
      <li>An identifier can only have alphanumeric characters (a-z , A-Z , 0-9) (i.e. letters & digits) and underscore(
        _
        ) symbol.</li>
      <li>Identifier names must be unique</li>
      <li>The first character must be an alphabet or underscore.</li>
      <li>You cannot use a keyword as identifiers</li>
      <li>Only the first thirty-one (31) characters are significant.</li>
      <li>It must not contain white spaces.</li>
      <li>Identifiers are case-sensitive.</li>
      <h2>Variables & Constants</h2>
      <h3>Variables</h3>
      In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.<br>
      To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just
      the
      symbolic representation of a memory location. <br>
      Example:
      <pre> <code class="language-clike">
            int playerScore = 95;</code>
            </pre>
      Here, playerScore is a variable of int type. Here, the variable is assigned an integer value 95.
      <h3>Rules for naming a variable</h3>
      <li>A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore.</li>
      <li>The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.</li>
      <li>There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into problems in some
        compilers if the variable name is longer than 31 characters.</li>
      <h2>Constants</h2>
      C Constants is the most fundamental and essential part of the C programming language. Constants in C are the fixed
      values that are used in a program, and its value remains the same during the entire execution of the program.<br>
      <li>Constants are also called literals.</li>
      <li>Constants can be any of the data types.</li>
      <li>It is considered best practice to define constants using only upper-case names.</li>
      Example:
      <pre> <code class="language-clike">
                const double PI = 3.14;  </code>
            </pre>
      Notice, we have added keyword const.
      Here, PI is a symbolic constant; its value cannot be changed.
      <h2>C Data Types</h2>
      The data-type in a programming language is the collection of data with values having fixed meaning as well as
      characteristics. Some of them are an integer, floating point, character, etc. Usually, programming languages
      specify
      the range values for given data-type.
      <h3>C Data Types are used to:</h3>
      <li>Identify the type of a variable when it declared.</li>
      <li>Identify the type of the return value of a function.</li>
      <li>Identify the type of a parameter expected by a function.</li>
      <h3>C provides three types of data types:</h3>
      <li>Primary(Built-in) Data Types:<br>
        void, int, char, double and float.</li>
      <li>Derived Data Types:<br>
        Array, References, and Pointers.</li>
      <li>User Defined Data Types:<br>
        Structure, Union, and Enumeration.</li>
      <h3>Primary Data Types</h3>
      Every C compiler supports five primary data types:
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <td>void</td>
          <td>As the name suggests, it holds no value and is generally used for specifying the type of function or what
            it
            returns. If the function has a void type, it means that the function will not return any value.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>int</td>
          <td>Used to denote an integer type.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>char</td>
          <td>Used to denote a character type.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>float, double</td>
          <td>Used to denote a floating point type.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>int *, float *, char *</td>
          <td>Used to denote a pointer type.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Derived Data Types</h3>
      C supports three derived data types:
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <td>Arrays</td>
          <td>Arrays are sequences of data items having homogeneous values. They have adjacent memory locations to store
            values.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>References</td>
          <td>Function pointers allow referencing functions with a particular signature.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pointers</td>
          <td>These are powerful C features which are used to access the memory and deal with their addresses.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>User Defined Data Types</h3>
      C allows the feature called type definition which allows programmers to define their identifier that would
      represent
      an existing data type.<br>
      There are three such types:
      <table style="width:100%">
        <tr>
          <td>Structure</td>
          <td>It is a package of variables of different types under a single name. This is done to handle data
            efficiently. "struct" keyword is used to define a structure.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Union</td>
          <td>These allow storing various data types in the same memory location. Programmers can define a union with
            different members, but only a single member can contain a value at a given time.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Enum</td>
          <td>Enumeration is a special data type that consists of integral constants, and each of them is assigned with
            a
            specific name. "enum" keyword is used to define the enumerated data type.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h2>Operators</h2>
      C operators are symbols that are used to perform mathematical or logical manipulations. The C programming language
      is rich with built-in operators. Operators take part in a program for manipulating data and variables and form a
      part of the mathematical or logical expressions.
      <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
      Arithmetic Operators are used to performing mathematical calculations like addition (+), subtraction (-),
      multiplication (*), division (/) and modulus (%).
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th> Operator</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+</td>
          <td>Addition</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>-</td>
          <td>Subtraction</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>*</td>
          <td>Multiplication</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/</td>
          <td>Division</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>%</td>
          <td>Modulus</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Increment and Decrement Operators</h3>
      Increment and Decrement Operators are useful operators generally used to minimize the calculation, i.e. ++x and
      x++
      means x=x+1 or -x and x−−means x=x-1. But there is a slight difference between ++ or −− written before or after
      the
      operand. Applying the pre-increment first add one to the operand and then the result is assigned to the variable
      on
      the left whereas post-increment first assigns the value to the variable on the left and then increment the
      operand.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th> Operator</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>++</td>
          <td>Increment</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>--</td>
          <td>Decrement</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Relational Operators</h3>
      Relational operators are used to comparing two quantities or values.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th> Operator</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>==</td>
          <td>Is equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>!=</td>
          <td>Is not equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>></td>
          <td>Greater than</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            < </td>
          <td>Less than</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>>=</td>
          <td>Greater than or equal to</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <=< /td>
          <td>Less than or equal to</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Logical Operators</h3>
      C provides three logical operators when we test more than one condition to make decisions. These are: && (meaning
      logical AND), || (meaning logical OR) and ! (meaning logical NOT).
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th> Operator</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&&</td>
          <td>And operator. It performs logical conjunction of two expressions. (if both expressions evaluate to True,
            result is True. If either expression evaluates to False, the result is False)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>||</td>
          <td>Or operator. It performs a logical disjunction on two expressions. (if either or both expressions evaluate
            to True, the result is True)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>!</td>
          <td>Not operator. It performs logical negation on an expression.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Bitwise Operators</h3>
      C provides a special operator for bit operation between two variables.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th> Operator</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <<< /td>
          <td>Binary Left Shift Operator</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>>></td>
          <td> Binary Right Shift Operator</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>~</td>
          <td>Binary Ones Complement Operator</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&</td>
          <td>Binary AND Operator</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>^</td>
          <td>Binary XOR Operator</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>|</td>
          <td>Binary OR Operator
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Assignment Operators</h3>
      Assignment operators applied to assign the result of an expression to a variable. C has a collection of shorthand
      assignment operators.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th> Operator</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>=</td>
          <td>Assign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>+=</td>
          <td>Increments then assign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>-=</td>
          <td>Multiplies then assign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>*=</td>
          <td>Binary AND Operator</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>/=</td>
          <td>Divides then assign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>%=</td>
          <td>Modulus then assign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            <<=< /td>
          <td>Left shift and assign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>>>=</td>
          <td>Right shift and assign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>&=</td>
          <td>Bitwise AND assign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>^=</td>
          <td>Bitwise exclusive OR and assign</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>|=</td>
          <td>Bitwise inclusive OR and assign</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Conditional Operators</h3>
      C offers a ternary operator which is the conditional operator (?: in combination) to construct conditional
      expressions.
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th> Operator</th>
          <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>? :</td>
          <td>Conditional Expression</td>
        </tr>
